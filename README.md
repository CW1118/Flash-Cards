# Study-Buddy
A study tool for students with text and speech functionality.

This script is in the early stages of development, but my plan for "Study Buddy" is to integrate Google's speech 
recognition and text to speech libraries to make a virtual study partner. Currently the only study material I have
built into the program is some simple boolean statements.

When the program starts it will ask whether you want to study using voice or text.  The user's decision 
from here will either run the voice() or the text() function. The text() function will pick random questions from the 
'material' dictionary and then give a prompt for the user to type the answer.  The program will then print out whether
the input is correct or incorrect.  Regardless of the answer being right or wrong it will proceed to the next question
resulting in a never ending study session.

The voice() function will work in a similar way except it will audibly read you the question and then expect a verbal
response from the user.

As with all of my projects on GitHub I'm using this script as a method for me to better my programming skills, however
I still welcome anyone who wants to contribute to my projects to do so.

Thanks for checking out Study Buddy!
